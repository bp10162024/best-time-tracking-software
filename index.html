                    <p>There’s also a tool that captures employees’ screens at random times so you can see what they’re working on. In addition, you can track their website activities to find out if they visit any sites that hinder their productivity while they’re at work. The daily and weekly productivity reports can be useful as well.</p>

                    <h2>How To Choose Time Tracking Software</h2>
                    <p>Not all time tracking software is created equal. To help you find the ideal option for your unique situation, consider the following.</p>
                    <h3>Essential Features</h3>
                    <ul class="ms-arrow-list">
                        <li>Time tracking: This lets you keep track of how your employees spend their time while on the job.</li>
                        <li>Timesheets: Timesheets calculate the work your employees perform in terms of billable hours so you can simplify billing and invoicing.</li>
                        <li>Reporting: Most time tracking software creates reports on active employee hours, tasks employees complete and more.</li>
                        <li>Integrations: Integrations with project management and communication tools such as Salesforce, Asana and Slack are important if you’d like to maximize performance.</li>
                        <li>Mobile app: With a mobile app, you and your employees can manage your time from anywhere.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Consider Your Business Processes</h3>
                    <p>The way you run your business and perform your work will determine the best time tracking solution. It’s a good idea to ask yourself these questions:</p>
                    <ul class="ms-arrow-list">
                        <li>Do you work in an office or away from the office?</li>
                        <li>Are you a freelancer or solopreneur or a small to medium-sized business with employees?</li>
                        <li>Do you use Trello, Asana or other project management apps?</li>
                        <li>How do you communicate with your employees and clients?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you’re typically away from the office and out in the field, for example, a robust mobile app should be your priority. In the event you’re a small business with several employees, investing in a paid time tracking solution may make more sense than if you’re self-employed with no employees.</p>
                    <h3>Stand-alone Software vs. Suites</h3>
                    <p>A stand-alone time tracker is a basic tool that lets you record the time spent on projects and tasks. In most cases, you’ll need to manually enter your time and categorize it. A time tracking suite, on the other hand, is more robust and offers bells and whistles, such as schedule management, geo-tracking, easy integrations and more.</p>
                    <h2>What Does Time Tracking Software Cost?</h2>
                    <p>When it comes to pricing for time tracking software, it varies greatly. Typically, however, most solutions will charge you a flat monthly rate plus a rate per user. Factors including specific features and the number of employees you have will dictate what you pay for a time tracking tool. Keep in mind that sometimes, you won’t be able to find pricing information online and will need to reach out to the company directly for a custom quote.</p>
